# Machine Learning Project (CS465)



## 📌 Project Title: QS University Ranking Prediction & Analysis 


## 📄 Abstract

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict QS Overall Scores for universities worldwide using the QS University Rankings 2025 dataset. It involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, engineering features, training multiple models, and evaluating their performance. The study aims to identify key factors influencing university rankings and provide insights through predictive analytics.


## 🎯 **Project Objectives**
1. Identify key factors influencing university rankings and academic reputation.
2. Analyze correlations between institutional, research, and demographic features.
3. Determine the most impactful features and provide data-driven insights.
4. Build predictive models to estimate QS Overall Scores for universities.


## 📊 **Dataset**
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset - QS University Rankings 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrylljk/worlds-best-universities-qs-rankings-2025)
- **Description**: Includes 1503 records with 16 features.
- **Key Feature**: QS Overall Score (Target Variable)


## ⚙️ **Methodology**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
   - Handled missing values in rankings and numerical columns.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (Institution Name, 2025 Rank, 2024 Rank).
   - Imputed missing QS scores based on ranking position.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - **Train-test split (80-20)** for model evaluation.
   - **Machine Learning Models 🔜** 
    - Linear Regression
   - **Model Evaluation 🔜** (Soon)

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of QS scores.
   - More Visualization 🔜 (Soon)
